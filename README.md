# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Customer Online Shopping Dataset (EDA_1)

## 📝 Introduction
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a customer online shopping dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that can drive data-driven decisions. The dataset includes attributes such as:

- **Customer Demographics:** Age, gender, location
- **Financial Data:** Monthly income, credit score
- **Purchasing Behavior:** Quantity, price, product category, and campaign schema

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior, identify trends, and uncover insights to enhance customer engagement, optimize marketing strategies, and boost business performance.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following key attributes:
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Age`, `Gender`: Customer demographics.
- `Country`, `State`, `City`: Geographical attributes.
- `MonthlyIncome`, `CreditScore`: Financial attributes.
- `Price`, `Quantity`, `Category`: Purchasing details.
- `CampaignSchema`: Marketing campaigns used for customer acquisition.
- `OrderReturn`: Whether an order was returned or not.
- `OrderConfirmationTime`: Timestamp of order confirmation.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed irrelevant columns (`ReturnReason`, `Cost`).
   - Addressed missing values and duplicates.
   - Handled outliers by filtering unrealistic price values.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created new features: `Revenue`, `YearMonth`, `AgeGroup`.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Covariance and Correlation matrices.
   - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).

4. **Visualizations:**
   - Box plots, scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, line plots, and heatmaps.

5. **Exploratory Analysis:**
   - Customer distribution by country, state, and city.
   - Age and gender distribution.
   - Monthly income variation across countries.
   - Revenue generated by age groups and campaign schema.
   - Revenue trends over time.
   - Analysis of confirmed orders from specific marketing campaigns.
   - Quantity of products sold by gender, category, and payment method.
   - Return rate of orders and average credit score per gender.
